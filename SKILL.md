# wt — Git Worktree Manager

`wt` is a CLI for managing git worktrees. It provides an interactive TUI to browse, create, open in your IDE, and delete worktrees across multiple repos.

## Commands

### `wt` (no subcommand)

Launch the interactive TUI. Always shows worktrees across all registered repos, no matter where it is run. The current repo (if any) is auto-registered for discovery, but is never used to scope the list to a single repo.

**Keybindings in the TUI:**

- Arrow keys — navigate
- `Enter` — open worktree in IDE (exits the TUI)
- `D` — delete worktree (the main worktree is tagged `(main)` and cannot be deleted — only linked worktrees can)
- `P` — prune all merged worktrees (per-branch confirmation)
- `C` — create a new worktree
- `A` — create a worktree and start an AI agent in it
- type to search · `Backspace` — edit search
- `Q` / `Esc` — quit

`C` and `A` are step-by-step wizards. They **always** start by prompting for the
repo (picker), then the branch. `A` then adds two more steps:

- `C` — **worktree (repo → branch)**
- `A` — **worktree (repo → branch) → plan prompt → permission mode**

Pressing `Esc` at any step goes back to the previous step (your earlier answers
are preserved); pressing `Esc` on the first step returns to the list.

After a create or agent action the TUI **refreshes and stays open** on the list
(your search and cursor are preserved) rather than exiting — only `Enter` (open)
and `Q`/`Esc` exit.

Because `a`/`A`, `c`/`C`, `d`/`D`, and `p`/`P` are reserved as command keys,
those letters can't be typed into the search box.

### `wt create [branch] [--repo <path>]`

Create a new worktree. Always prompts you to pick the target repo from the registered repos first (the current repo is auto-registered for discovery but never assumed). If `branch` is omitted, prompts for it too. In a non-interactive shell it exits non-zero because the repo picker needs a TTY.

Pass `--repo <path>` to target a repo explicitly and skip the picker. The path is resolved against the current directory and validated as a git repo root; a path that is not a git repository errors (`✗ <path> is not a git repository`) and nothing is created. The resolved repo is also registered for future discovery.

The worktree is created as a sibling directory to the repo: `<parent>/<repo-name>-<branch-name>`.

After creation, `wt` runs any configured `setup_commands` and opens the worktree in your IDE.

If the worktree path already exists, `wt create` doesn't error — it prompts you
to **open it in the IDE** or **quit**. (In a non-interactive shell it errors
with a non-zero exit instead of prompting.)

### `wt agent <branch> <plan_prompt> [--mode <mode>] [--repo <path>]`

Create a worktree (same as `wt create`) **and** auto-start an AI agent in Zed's
integrated terminal, pre-filled with `<plan_prompt>` and left interactive for
you to take over.

```bash
wt agent feature/login 'Read the codebase, then propose a plan for login.'
wt agent feature/fix 'Fix the bug in payment processing' --mode auto
wt agent refactor/api 'Refactor the API layer' --mode default
wt agent feature/login 'Plan login' --repo ~/dev/my-project   # skip the picker
```

Like `wt create`, it always prompts for the target repo unless `--repo <path>`
is given (same validation: the path must be a git repo root, else it errors and
creates nothing).

The `--mode` flag sets Claude Code's permission mode (defaults to `default`;
change the default with the `agent_mode` config key):

- `default` — Standard interactive mode with approval for each action (default)
- `acceptEdits` — Allow file changes but keep command execution controlled
- `plan` — Architecture-first mode with no surprise mutations
- `auto` — Claude's safety model makes decisions instead of prompting
- `dontAsk` — Minimal interruptions in trusted environments
- `bypassPermissions` — Skip all permission checks (dangerous, CI/sandbox only)

It writes a temporary `.zed/tasks.json` running
`<agent_command> --permission-mode <mode> '<plan_prompt>'`, ensures a global Zed keymap chord
(`agent_trigger_chord`) spawns that task, opens Zed, presses the chord via
`osascript`, then removes the temporary task so the repo is left clean.

**macOS + Zed only.** Requires Accessibility permission for the app that runs
`wt` (Zed itself, when run from its integrated terminal). If it isn't granted,
`wt agent` opens the _Privacy & Security → Accessibility_ settings pane and waits
for you to grant it and confirm, then retries automatically. On other platforms
(or when `ide` is not `zed`) the worktree is still created and opened, but the
agent is not auto-started.

Over SSH it still works, provided the same user has an active graphical login on
the Mac: the keystroke is run inside the GUI session via Launch Services
(`open -a Terminal` briefly flashes a Terminal window). Grant Accessibility to
Terminal (not Zed) the first time. With no one logged in graphically there is
nothing to drive, so it falls back to the manual "press the chord in Zed"
message.

If the worktree path already exists, `wt agent` prompts you to **open it in the
IDE**, **open it and start the agent**, or **quit** — instead of erroring. (In a
non-interactive shell it errors with a non-zero exit instead of prompting.)

### `wt prune`

Remove every worktree whose branch has already been merged into the base
branch (`base_branch`, default `origin/main`). Each candidate is confirmed
individually — and force-confirmed when git refuses (submodules / uncommitted
changes), exactly like a manual `d` delete. The branch itself is left intact;
only the worktree is removed.

```bash
wt prune   # review and remove merged worktrees, one prompt per branch
```

Merge detection works in tiers. A branch whose diff already exists in base by
patch id (via `git cherry`, so a single-commit branch **squash-merged** through a
PR is recognized offline) is merged. For the ambiguous case — the branch tip is
an ancestor of base but 0 commits ahead, which a **fast-forward / merge-commit**
merge and a worktree holding only *uncommitted* work both produce — it consults
the **forge**: a merged PR/MR (via `gh` for GitHub, `glab` for GitLab incl.
self-hosted, auto-detected from the remote) is the only reliable signal. If the
forge can't answer (CLI missing, offline, branch unpushed, no merged PR/MR) the
branch is left alone. A worktree still sitting exactly on the base commit is
never offered. `wt prune` also best-effort fetches the remote first so detection
sees up-to-date refs; if the
base ref can't be resolved (e.g. offline), nothing is removed. Always runs across
all registered repos (each against its own `base_branch`). The TUI exposes the
same action under the `p` key.

### `wt config`

Open the global config file in `$EDITOR` (defaults to `nano`).

```bash
wt config          # open in editor
wt config --path   # print config file path only
```

### `wt skill`

Print this skill file to stdout. Useful for piping to agents or copying to a project.

## Configuration

Config is stored as JSON. Get the path with `wt config --path`.

### Per-repo overrides

Override any field (`worktree_path`, `base_branch`, `setup_commands`, `teardown_commands`, `ide`, `ide_open_args`, `agent_command`, `agent_mode`, `agent_trigger_chord`) for a specific repo. `auto_refresh_minutes` is global-only and cannot be overridden per repo:

```json
{
  "base_branch": "origin/main",
  "ide": "zed",
  "repo_overrides": {
    "/path/to/my-repo": {
      "base_branch": "origin/develop",
      "setup_commands": ["npm install", "npm run build"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Command templating

`setup_commands`, `teardown_commands`, and `agent_command` are expanded for
`{{…}}` placeholders just before they run. Whitespace inside the braces is
allowed (`{{ branch }}` == `{{branch}}`) and names are case-sensitive. An
unknown or unavailable variable is left **verbatim** (never blanked out).
Values are inserted raw (no shell-escaping), so quote them yourself if a value
could contain spaces.

| Variable        | Expands to                              | Available in                                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `{{branch}}`    | The worktree's branch name              | `setup_commands`, `teardown_commands`, `agent_command` |
| `{{project}}`   | The repo directory name (basename)      | `setup_commands`, `teardown_commands`, `agent_command` |
| `{{path}}`      | Absolute path to the worktree           | `setup_commands`, `teardown_commands`, `agent_command` |
| `{{repo_root}}` | Absolute path to the repo root          | `setup_commands`, `teardown_commands`, `agent_command` |
| `{{prompt}}`    | The agent plan prompt                   | `agent_command` only                             |

In `agent_command`, `{{prompt}}` is replaced by the plan prompt: if you include
it, the prompt is placed exactly there (and is **not** also auto-appended). If
you omit `{{prompt}}`, the prompt is appended automatically (single-quoted) at
the end, as before.

```json
{
  "agent_command": "claude --remote-control {{branch}}",
  "setup_commands": ["direnv allow {{path}}"]
}
```

## Common workflows

### Create a worktree for a new feature

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
wt create feature/my-branch
```

### Configure setup commands for a repo

```bash
wt config
# Then add to the JSON:
# "repo_overrides": {
#   "/path/to/repo": {
#     "setup_commands": ["npm install"]
#   }
# }
```

### Pass the branch to your agent (templating)

```bash
wt config
# Then set:
# "agent_command": "claude --remote-control {{branch}}"
```

`wt agent feature/login '…'` now runs `claude --remote-control feature/login …`.

### Browse all worktrees across repos

Run `wt` from anywhere — it always lists worktrees from all registered repos.
